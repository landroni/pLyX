pLyX system.
************

The pLyX system is a scripting system for LyX. Or rather, LyX has a built-in scripting system, but it seems to have been created by accident, few know of it, and it has certainly received no development to make its use convenient for the user. The pLyX system is an attempt to create a workable interface for this system out of the tools that LyX provides -- modules, custom insets, toolbar buttons -- and also to provide some initial scripts.

The zip archive should be extracted to a directory of your convenience. A description of how to set up the pLyX system can be found in Ch.2 of the document "pLyX.20.lyx" in the "doc" folder. In summary, the contents of the various folders go into the corresponding folders of your personal LyX2.0 directory. However, there are also two file formats and two converters to set up and an overwrite setting to change, for which the instructions are in "pLyX.20.lyx", Ch.2.
